approach:
  text: >
    We believe that the best solutions come from collaboration between the best people. By 
    taking a fully integrated approach to project support we support your team and strengthen 
    your research not as an outside voice, but as a fully fledged team-member

      text: >
        By investigating market landscapes through secondary sources like news articles, 
        product pipelines, or ethnographic studies, we’ll help your team understand the 
        broader context in which your clients are situated and leverage this background 
        to design targeted qualitative research tools, including surveys, messaging materials, 
        and discussion guides
    - name: Gather meticulous data
      text: >
        No matter what form your research takes, the data-gathering phase is key—and so is our support. 
        By participating in the interview process, running surveys, or providing detailed transcripts 
        and notes, we’ll keep your data organized, streamlined, and ready to analyze
    - name: Develop meaningful insights
      text: >
        Your clients count on you for insightful analysis, and we stand prepared to help you deliver. 
        Using qualitative methodologies, we’ll code and analyze project data in collaboration with 
        your research team. By discovering patterns in open ended conversations and turning close coded 
        questions into quantified trends we can help uncover the key insights your clients anticipate
    - name: Deliver compelling presentations
      text: >
        The end of every research project needs an expertly crafted, deliverable report, and no matter 
        the format —from a written document to a streamlined powerpoint—we are prepared to help bring 
        it together. By taking the team’s insights and discussing them in your client’s own language 
        we can assist in building the perfect final presentation

        What holds us back? How do we connect to the people around us?

        Since graduating from the University of Chicago with an MA in the Social Sciences, I’ve been able to explore the 
        lives of consumers across some of the world’s most innovative markets and to gain insight into the ways they relate 
        to the world around them.

        Acanthus was founded with the goal of leveraging trusted methodologies to bring adept support to market research 
        firms, and to explore dichotomies that define us. The researcher and the consumer. The lure of future and weight 
        of history. The legacy and innovation of research. All coming together and growing into the human experience.
